# Car Sales Project

## Overview

The Car Sales Project aims to provide an overview of key sales metrics and trends to help stakeholders assess overall business performance. This project focuses on important indicators like total sales, Total profit, Customer count, order volume, discount, and more applied. It allows users to compare year-on-year changes and analyze sales distribution across various channels.

## Tools Used

**Kaggle:** Used Kaggle to download datasets, providing a diverse range of data for analysis.

**Python Libraries:** Utilized Python libraries like pandas and numpy for cleaning and preprocessing data.

**Ms Power BI:** Leveraged MS Power BI to create interactive dashboards for visualizing and understanding data.

**Ms Word:** Used MS Word to generate comprehensive reports, summarizing insights and findings from analysis.

## Key Metrics

**Sales & Profit**

Sales over the past 20 years were worth $553.5M with a profit of $360M, showing consistent growth except for the drop in 2020. This is evidence of strong market presence, though recovery efforts after 2020 need to be towards long-term growth.

**Orders & Quantity**

10,000 orders translated into 49,000 car sales of which the leading brand was Ford. Nevertheless, a decline in orders in the previous year by 8.7% suggests conducting market analysis as a reaction to potential demand shifts.

**Sales Over Time**

Most of the buyers are 60-70 years old, and women are interested 7.4% more than men. The favorite colors are Mauv, Yellow, and Orange, with Ford's Mustang being the favorite. These figures suggest targeting the older group for marketing and offering a variety of car models and colors to suit demand.

## Recommendations

The trend of growing sales is slowed down by flat customer growth, especially in the 60-70 category. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 sales highlights the necessity of responsiveness to market reversals. The future plans must concentrate on younger buyers and dynamic pricing and web sales to insulate against crises.
